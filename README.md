# wednesday-clock
 
A normal word clock is useful when your life operates in five minute intervals; when you need the time but aren't concerned with silly details like "minutes" or "seconds". It's fair to say I don't think very highly of word clocks. They could be worse, though. A worse clock might not tell you the time at all. Instead, it might just tell you, "It is Wednesday, my dudes," whenever it is Wednesday. This clock does exactly that. Don't ask me why.
